## Challenges we ran into
One of the biggest challenges we faced was integrating with Google Calendar. Accessing an external API is an asynchronous procedure, and we had to make a clever series of callbacks from the chatbot to fetch and update events in the calendar.

## Accomplishments that we'are proud of

## What we learned
-Through a store visit survey, we found that most restaurants face daily problems that they waste their unsold, surplus foods and these foods end up being thrown way in most of the time.
